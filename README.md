## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science graduate** from UC Riverside with **4+ years of experience** specializing in **Extended Reality (XR/VR)** development and **product design**. I bridge the gap between technical implementation and user-centered design, creating immersive experiences that are both technically robust and intuitive.

Throughout my career, I've developed AR/VR applications at **Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence** and **Brain Game Center**, trained **30+ professionals** in Unity and AR development as a **Freelance Unity Developer**, and designed **100+ animations** at **Scaler** that increased engagement by 35%. Currently working as a **UX Designer & Frontend Developer at WinWinLabs**, where I design AI-powered IoT dashboards and build scalable design systems.

💡 **What drives me:** Combining spatial computing, procedural generation, and thoughtful UX to build interactive experiences that push the boundaries of what's possible in XR.
